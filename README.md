# CURE-E Final Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the growth and accessibility of public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the United States over the past five years. Using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we develop a data management program that utilizes advanced data structures to organize, analyze, and provide insights into the data.

## Description
The project aims to provide insights into the growth and accessibility of public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States. By analyzing data from NOAA, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the distribution, trends, and accessibility of EV charging infrastructure.

## Research Questions
1. How has the number of public EV charging stations evolved over the past five years?
2. Which states have the highest concentration of public EV charging stations?
3. What are the trends in the accessibility of EV charging stations in rural versus urban areas?

## Stakeholders
- Policymakers: To inform policies related to EV infrastructure development and sustainability initiatives.
- EV Manufacturers: To identify regions with high demand for EVs and prioritize infrastructure investment.
- Environmental Organizations: To assess the impact of EV charging infrastructure on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Problem-Solving Approach
- **Data Loading**: Load EV charging station data from a CSV file using a DataLoader class.
- **Data Processing**: Analyze the loaded data to answer research questions using a DataProcessor class.
- **User Interaction**: Provide a command-line menu interface for users to interact with the program and perform various operations.

## User Guide
